<h2>Description</h2>
<p itemprop="description">
Experience restful nights with the Moon Gold divan bed, part of the refined NEST &amp; LIVING collection. This divan bed offers a modern, minimalist design with timeless appeal, designed to enhance comfort and style in your bedroom. Although this model carries the Gold tier name, it does not imply materials but reflects its premium position in the collection.
</p>
<p>
The bed is available in two tasteful color options: classic beige, as shown here with the Primo 05 textile, and a sleek anthracite alternative. Comfort is tailored to your needs by choosing between a zoned 7-pocket spring system for targeted body support or an adaptive memory foam mattress option. The frame is constructed from durable wood, ensuring long-lasting quality backed by an impressive 4000-day guarantee.
</p>
<p>
The Moon Gold divan bed stands on tall, cone-shaped legs finished in smoked ash, enhancing the bed's lightness and facilitating easy cleaning around and beneath the frame. For a fully customized sleep experience, add mattress toppers or headboards sold separately to elevate the bed’s comfort and adapt the setup to your personal style.
</p>
<p>
Maintenance is simple; regular vacuuming and occasional wiping with a damp cloth keep the upholstery fresh while preserving the bed’s elegant look.
</p>
<p>
Combining functionality, comfort, and elegant style, the Moon Gold divan bed offers excellent value for the Gold tier in the NEST &amp; LIVING range, turning your bedroom into a serene and practical retreat.
